# Data Coverage

An important topic for evaluating the success of ESEF-based regulatory reporting
is establishing the 'denominator' on which all counting is based: the set of firms
who are subject to the ESEF mandate.


## ESEF Mandate Conditions

### Who is required to implement ESEF?

"All issuers subject to the requirements contained in the Transparency Directive to make public AFRs."[^2]

### Which country regulates an issuer's disclosures?

- For EU issuers, country where they are registered [^3]
- For non-EU issuers, country "chosen by the issuer from amongst the Member States where its securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market" [^4]
- Otherwise, based on issue choice amongst registered offices and/or countries where securities trading takes place [^5]

## Definitions

- **Issuer**: "means a natural person, or a legal entity governed by private or public law, including a State,
  whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market" [^1]
