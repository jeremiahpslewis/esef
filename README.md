# ESEF Data Product

> Research Data Access for the European Single Electronic Format

With the introdcution of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) for annual financial reports, corporate financial data in the European Union becomes standardized and machine readable for the first time. Use of the format is binding for financial year 2020 and later and as companies begin to publish using ESEF, there are significant opportunities and challenges ahead for the accounting research community.

As part of TRR266, funding has been obtained to empower and enable research using these documents. By incubating this project as open source from the outset, we hope to attract contributions from academia and industry and avoid the privatization of this emerging open data resource.

[ESEF is a standard based on XBRL][esef_home], but
